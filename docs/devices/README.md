# The Device Feature Category

The Device feature category allows the creation of Devices, which are containers for connections of Controllers and Sensors. These act as connectors between the inputs specified in the [Environment](./environment/README.md) category, the outputs specified in the [Actions](./actions/README.md) category and external APIs.
