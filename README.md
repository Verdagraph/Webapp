# VerdanTech

This is the home repository for the VerdanTech web application - an application striving towards creating software tools to automate gardening in a collaborative way - including planning, tracking, optimizing, and automating growing plants. This project is still in its early stages and lacks documentation. You can see the previous version of this project (here)[https://github.com/nathanielarking/Autonomous-Agriculture].

In terms of infrastructure, the project aims to create a REST api using Django Rest Framework, and a frontend Svelte SPA.

Eventually, the application will be integrated with embedded automation projects. Those have a seperate repository, which you can find (here)[https://github.com/nathanielarking/VerdanTech-Devices/tree/main/VerdanTech%20Drip%20-%20Irrigation%20Controller]
