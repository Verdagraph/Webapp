/**
 * Given a geometry, returns an array of coordinates
 * where each coordinate is a point on the shape which
 * can be dragged to resize the shape. Two geometries
 * of the same type will have exactly the same number
 * of resize points, unless the geometry is a lines geometry,
 * in which case it will have a point for each coordinate.
 *
 * The points are different for each geometry type:
 *
 * For a rectangle, there is a point at each corner,
 * and a point in the middle of each side. The points
 * start at the top left corner, meaning that even
 * points are corners and odd points are sides.
 * 0----1----2
 * |		 |
 * 7		 3

 * 6----5----4
 *
 * For an ellise, there is a point at each side,
 * starting from the top.
 *     0

 * For a polygon, there is a one point, at the top.

 * For a lines geometry described by a set of points,
 * the resize points are simply the set of points.
