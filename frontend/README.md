Code generation:

- Code is generated using the Orval library
- Types, Axios functions, and zod schemas for forms

Library folders:

- codegen - generated client code
- data - query and mutation hooks
- state - non-component specific reactive svelte state

Note: everything schould be autogenerated by schema, except zod schemas. The primitives for these should be generated by orval, then the schemas made by hand, adding client-side error descriptions.

note that the fontend is currently implemented assuming email confirmatino is mandatory

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
