# The Environment Feature Category

While the Workspace is a spatial container, an Environment is a container for ecological characteristcs, which can be attached to inputs, such as temperature, about the outside world. This feature integrates closely with the [Devices](/outline/devices/README.md), which act allow connection of environmental variables to external APIs.
